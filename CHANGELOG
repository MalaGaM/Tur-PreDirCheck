Changelog for Tur-PreDirCheck

1.4.1 : Fixed:
        One obselete setting removed from the script. This setting had
        already been removed from the config part and broke the test
        phase of dirloglist_gl. Also got a report that checking if the
        dir existed previously did not work because of this, but I fail to
        see how.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Added dirloglist_gl for glftpd 2.* as well. No version update.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.4   : Changed:
        As with Tur-Search, I've abandoned the use of strings to
        search the dirlog if the release is already on site.
        Instead, I use dirloglist_gl which is a modified 
        dirloglist to work inside glftpd.
        Its much faster to use and speed is good when it comes
        to predircheck scripts.

        Changed:
        Removed a few settings I didnt feel were needed, like the
        parent checking etc.. It will now always check if the release
        was upped in any of the dirs, no matter its section.

        Changed:
        Some settings were changed to a real egrep line.. see default
        script.

       If you're going to upgrade, it might be best to start from 
       scratch.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.3   : Added:
        NUKE_PREFIX="_NUKED-"
        Its ment for people who does not use the strings binary
        to check if a dir was on site before or nuked.
        In other words, those with CHECKPREEXISTS=FALSE

        Just add your setting for how a nuked release is prefixed.

        Note that this option is useless if you have CHECKPREEXISTS=TRUE
        as that one does this same check and more.
        
        Leave NUKE_PREFIX="" to disable.

        It uses ERROR2 and IERROR2 for announce (same as CHECKPREEXISTS uses).

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.2 : Fixed:
        ALLOWDIRS_OVERRULES_DENYDIRS didnt work due to
        spelling error.        

        Manual fix, look for:
        if [ "$DENYDIRS" ] && [ "$ALLOW_OVERRULE_DIRS" != "TRUE" ]; then
        Change to:
        if [ "$DENYDIRS" ] && [ "$ALLOW_OVERRULE_DIR" != "TRUE" ]; then

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.1 : Fixed:
        The ALLOWFILE now works for stuff denied from all places
        where a release would be denied previously.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.2   : Added:
        ALLOWDIRS  for those sections where you only allow
                   certain groups/releases.

        ERROR5     for announcing denials based on this to the user
                   in glftpd.
        IERROR5    for announcing denials based on this to irc.

        ALLOWDIRS_OVERRULES_DENYGROUPS  See the README

        ALLOWDIRS_OVERRULES_DENYDIRS    See the README

        SKUPUSERS  For username exclude.

        SKIPGROUPS For skipping based on the user primary group (only).

        SKIPFLAGS  For skipping based on one or more flags.

        Changed:
        DENYGROUPS & DENYDIRS can now be specified per section.
        Simply use Path:deny1|deny2|etc

        To still use a global ban, specify /site as path.
        /site:deny1|deny2|etc

        Changed all "exit 1" to "exit 2" (again). Thanks LPC.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.1   : Added
        DENYGROUPS for banned groups.
        DENYDIRS   for other stuff you dont want.
        GLLOG      for bot announce
        IERROR1-4  for what to say when breaking the rules.

        See the README for usage instructions.

        tur-dirallow.sh was updated to 1.1 too. It now only stores
        the last allowed dirname in the allowfile.
        Once the dir is created, another can be allowed, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.0   : Stealth updated =) Debug mode sent wrong ftp code,
        confusing some clients.

1.0   : Initial Release
